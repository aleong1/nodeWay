# nodeWay
James Huang, Richard Wong, Eddie Zhu
## To-do List
Organized in rough order of what we will implement!
### Instance Vars
**DLLNode _list//_will be the main deque that we  will be modifying_
### Methods
**size()** will tell us how many nodes there are in this deque, will be used in later functions. \n
**addLast()** equivalent to enqueueing, this will add to the end of the deque(the Last element of the deque)
**addFirst()** equivalent to enqueueing, this will add to the beginning of the deque(the first element of the deque)
The functions above comprise the primary adding functions, and are the ones we will code first!
**peekLast()** peeks at the last DLLNode in the deque, will be what we will remove if we call removeLast() (does not modify deque)
**peekFirst()** peeks at the first DLLNode in the deque, will be what we will remove if we call removeFirst() (does not modify deque)
The functions above are the functions that will allow us to view the elements we will remove in the future...
**removeLast()** removes last element in deque, returns it
**removeFirst()** removes first element in deque, returns it
